## The project
[Our lab](https://www.facebook.com/MAPLabCERVO) is interested in how  hearing interacts with the other senses. We are particularily interested in the sense of touch because of its ability to percieve vibrations. This relates to hearing, which is a sense specialized in percieving vibrations transmitted through the air in the form of pressure variations. This project aimed to develop a new haptic glove that transmits sounds in the form of vibrations to the skin of the hands.

## The poster
This poster was presented at the 16th Canadian Neuroscience Meeting of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience. [French versions]({{< relref path="multichannelglove.fr.md" lang="fr" >}}) were presented at the CRBLM Scientific Day 2023 and at the *Journées de la recherche 2023 de la Faculté de médecine et des centres affiliés* of Laval University.
